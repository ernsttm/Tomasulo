To retrieve the entire directory click on the green "Clone or Download" button, and choose the download as zip option.  Once the download is complete unzip the file. Using your favorite command line utility execute "./gradlew build" in the root directory of the unziped package.  This will build and execute the processor algorithm against all the unit tests included in the executable.  I have included a sample directory that has a copy of the output jar, all the dependencies required and a sample configuration and instructions file. The first page of the submitted report includes instructions on how to use the provided sample.
